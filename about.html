                     <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                     <p>Since I was a kid, I've had a passion for videogames and a connection to the activity that was unlike any other. 
                        On a regular basis, I would go home from school and immediately head up to my room and power on my computer. Starting with
                        the old disc games like Pajama Sam or Freddi Fish. From there I learned about the wonders of online gaming and discovered I
                        could play with my friends. My main interest in life became gaming; so much so, that the theme of my Bar Mitzvah was video games.
                        Minecraft was the game that set me on the path towards my career. I taught myself how to program some basic Java and about the 
                        concepts of servers and clients and all the necessary elements to be able to play this wonderful game of creativity with my friends. 
                        I went to a technology based STEM highschool where I dove more in depth into programming and computer science, 
                        which ultimately inspired me to become a computer science major in college. My love for video games still remains as I also
                        have a minor in Interactive Media and Game Development at WPI.

                     <h1>Interests</h1>
                     <p>Front end development is a topic of Computer Science that I have particularly
                        come to enjoy. From designing user interfaces, to web development, to modeling
                        a character for a game, I enjoy creating things for a user to see and interact
                        with. I've taken many courses such as webware, human computer interaction, and
                        computer graphics that have taught me these skills and fueled my interests. You 
                        can see some of my front end projects <a href="portfolio.html#front-end"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br/>
                        In my free time, I also enjoy creating <a href="portfolio.html#videos"><strong>videos</strong></a>. In
                        highschool, I was introduced to the editing software: Sony Vegas, which kickstarted
                        my interest in filming and editing videos. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/michaelbosik" target="__blank"><strong>youtube channel</strong></a> 
                        that I have uploaded multiple video projects I have worked on as well as videos 
                        that I made for fun.

                           <h1>Experiences</h1>
                           <p>One of the most perspective enriching experiences I've had was when I worked at CodeNinjas. I had the
                              opportunity to develop a curriculum for an educational summer camp involving programming and code concepts
                              for children. Drones, Minecraft, Scratch, Javascript Websites, all aspects of my childhood that I was to
                              pass on to these bright kids. Over the course of 8 weeks, I ran the full day camps with my co workers and
                              got to see the smiles on the children as their program actually made something happen and they got to experience
                              what I did once as a child.

                           <p>At WPI, in Sophomore year, I decided to join a fraternity to branch out and meet new people.
                              After a 7 week rush period and multiple events, I was inducted into Beta Theta Pi, Eta Tau chapter.
                              The chapter was intalled the day after my induction just in time for me to be a part of the historic event.
                              Beta has given me experiences that I otherwise would have never known in my college career such as
                              the volunteer work we do for Habitat for Humanity and our philanthropy events like Beta Theta Fries.
                              <br/>Being a Beta has also allowed me to expand my social circle and meet new people whom I otherwise
                              might have never made acquaintance. I am a member of the Kai committee and communications committee as of this year,
                              and I hope to take on leadership positions in the future.
