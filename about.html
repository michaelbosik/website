                           <p>Since I was a kid, I've had a passion for videogames and a connection to the activity that was unlike any other. 
                              On a regular basis, I would go home from school and immediately head up to my room and power on my computer. Starting with
                              the old disc games like Pajama Sam or Freddi Fish. From there I learned about the wonders of online gaming and discovered I
                              could play with my friends. My main interest in life became gaming; so much so, that the theme of my Bar Mitzvah was video games.
                              Minecraft was the game that set me on the path towards my career. I taught myself how to program some basic Java and about the 
                              concepts of servers and clients and all the necessary elements to be able to play this wonderful game of creativity with my friends. 
                              I went to a technology based STEM highschool where I dove more in depth into programming and computer science, 
                              which ultimately inspired me to become a computer science major in college. My love for video games still remains as I also
                              have a minor in Interactive Media and Game Development at WPI.
